* **Distraction-Free Learning Page:** We strongly believe that students should be able to focus on their courses entirely. And that's why we have put our utmost effort into making the learning page free of any distractions. The page is independent of your site design and based on React JS for a better learning experience. Additionally, students also get the complete freedom to hide the header and navigation section of the learning page if they want to.
