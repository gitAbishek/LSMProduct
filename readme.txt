With our easy quiz builder, one can create multiple quiz types like True/False, Single Choice, or MultiChoice questions to evaluate the students' progress through the course.

So, the learning page looks excellent in terms of both design and functionality.

* **Interactive Learning Page Header:** The header in the learning page comprises the site logo to return to the homepage of the site, course informative progress bar, and the student account.

* **Course Progressive Bar:** Interactive learning page comes with a dynamic course progressive bar at the top that helps students locate at which step of the course curriculum they are at. It provides students with ideas about the part of the course they've completed and the remaining parts that are yet to be completed. This percentage meter also encourages them to complete the course.

* **Learning Page Course Navigation:** You'll also find a vertical navigation section for courses at the left side of the learning page. It helps you navigate through all the sections, lessons, and quizzes of the course curriculum.

* **Distraction-Free Learning Page:** We strongly believe that students should be able to focus on their courses entirely. And that's why we have put our utmost effort into making the learning page free of any distractions. The page is independent of your site design and based on React JS for a better learning experience. Additionally, students also get the complete freedom to hide the header and navigation section of the learning page if they want to.
